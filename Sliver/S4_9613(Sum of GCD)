# 문제
# Given n positive integers, you have to find the summation of GCD (greatest common divisor) of 
# every possible pair of these integers. 
 
# 입력
# The first line of input is an integer n (1< n <100) that determines the number of test cases. 
# The following n lines are the n test cases. Each test case contains 2 parts:
# first part is the number m (1< m <100) indicating the number of input integers, 
# second part includes m positive integers. The input integers do not exceed 1000000. 

# 출력
# For each test case, show the summation of GCDs of every possible pair.
